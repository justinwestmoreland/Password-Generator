# Password-Generator

This project involved creating the logic to generate a random password based on five inputs, all front end design was provided however the layout was chaged to create a more linear understanding based on user feedback. My test users indicated that having the button below the text box gave them the impression that they needed to fill in the text box before clicking the button to begin user input. 

Once users click the button to begin, they will be propmpted for the following inputs:
1. How many characters the user needed their password to be, between 8 and 128.
2. Whether or not the user would like to use lowercase letters.
3. Whether or not the user would like to use uppercase letters.
4. Whether or not the user would like to use numbers.
5. Whether or not the user would like to use special characters.

My favorite part of this project was not only programming the logic for what to do when the user selects the correct choices, but looping through the possible combinations of incorrect user inputs and deciding how the website would respond.
